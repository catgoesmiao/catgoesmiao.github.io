hello all it has been a while... right now, i have been working on some sprites for melfi, as well as drafting cgs for key events...  
the harvest is sure to be fruitful. anyways, i will drop a prototype of the prologue ui down here!  
it's melfi!
![hey its melfi!](/assets/images/ui_example.jpg)  
my goal for these next few weeks is to get most of melfis sprites at least drafted...  
love,
