we are shaped, always, by the language we use  
deadline. progress. in a body of work that resists such limitations, why?  
or perhaps i should tighten the shackles, live as my creation

i have spent some TIME making sense of this painting  
"who preferred to free men by taking from them, rather than make them happy by giving to them"  
-walter benjamin  
motif of arrows. of renouncers.  
see to it that my heart will belong to this craft- as the spider is to the web, as the bee is to the hive  
with stimulant adulterated conviction,
